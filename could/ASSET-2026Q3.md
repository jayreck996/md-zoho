# ASSET Log - Zoho

## ASSET:zoho 2026-08-26 -> Zoho People -- platform decision: consolidate onboarding onto Zoho People (single platform)

- Decision: move new-hire onboarding off the stitched-together Learn + Forms + Flow + WorkDrive setup (see 2026Q2 log) onto Zoho People, aiming for one seamless platform instead of automation glue across separate apps
- Rationale: prior setup existed as a workaround for gaps in Learn/Forms/Flow (no Zoho Mail connection, no Learn enrollment trigger, no native attachments, no shared sandbox) -- People has onboarding natively (docs, e-signature, forms, checklists) so should close most of those gaps directly
- Scope to confirm during setup: whether Learn is retained for training content with People handing off to it, or whether People absorbs that too
- Status: decided -- setup in progress

## ASSET:zoho 2026-08-26 -> Zoho People -- email template location and native attachment support

- Location: Settings (gear icon) > Onboarding > Automation > Notifications -- lists all onboarding email alerts (Welcome Email to Candidate, Welcome Email to Employee, Candidate Onboarding Reinitiated Email, Employee Onboarding Reinitiated Email) plus a separate Onboarding Reminder email, each with its own toggle and "Edit Template" button
- Each template's editor (Edit Email Alert) has a native **Attachments** section directly under the message body, with three sources: Desktop (direct upload), Cloud (WorkDrive/cloud storage), Select Templates (pre-saved attachment library)
- Supported formats: .CSV, .DOC, .PDF, .XLS, .XLSX, .ZIP, .JPG, .JPEG, .PNG
- Attach once on the template and it auto-sends with every email that alert fires -- no separate Flow step or WorkDrive share-link workaround needed
- Confirmed on portal: transputeconboarding (people.zoho.eu), logged in as Super Administrator
- Supersedes: ISSUE:zoho 2026-06-23 -> Zoho Learn -- native email notifications do not support file attachments (2026Q2 log) -- that gap does not exist in Zoho People's onboarding email alerts
